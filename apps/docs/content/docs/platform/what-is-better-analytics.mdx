Better Analytics was born from a simple belief: **analytics should be built by developers, for developers**. We're not just another analytics platform - we're a love letter to the open source community and the indie hackers, makers, and shippers who build the web.

## Our Philosophy

**Open Source is in Our DNA:** Better Analytics exists because of the open source community. We've learned from countless projects, borrowed ideas from brilliant minds, and built upon the shoulders of giants. That's why we'll always be 100% open source - it's not just our code, it's our commitment to giving back to the community that made us possible.

**Developers First, Always:** We don't care about enterprise sales or marketing buzzwords. We care about you - the developer at 2 AM trying to understand why your app isn't working, the indie hacker launching their first product, the maker who just wants simple insights without the complexity. You are our north star.

**Privacy is Not Negotiable:** We believe privacy is a fundamental right, not a premium feature. No cookies, no tracking, no selling your users' data. Clean, anonymous analytics that respect both you and your users.

**Open Source Forever, SaaS with Value:** The core analytics platform will always be 100% open source and free to self-host. Our hosted SaaS service is free for indie hackers and makers, with optional premium features for teams who want extra convenience - but you can always deploy and run everything yourself at no cost.

## Why We Exist

The analytics landscape is broken. It's dominated by complex, expensive platforms that treat developers as an afterthought. We've all been there - spending hours integrating analytics, dealing with cookie banners, worrying about GDPR compliance, and paying more as we grow.

**We said "enough."**

Better Analytics is our answer to this frustration. We're building the analytics platform we wish existed when we were starting out. Simple, powerful, privacy-first, and completely free.

## Our Commitment to You

**To the Indie Hackers:** We know you're building the next big thing in your spare time. You need insights, not complexity. Better Analytics gives you what you need without the overhead.

**To the Open Source Maintainers:** You're building the future of software. We want to help you understand how your projects are being used, without compromising your values or your users' privacy.

**To the Students and Learners:** You're the future of our industry. Better Analytics is free for you to use, learn from, and build upon. Fork our code, submit PRs, break things, and make them better.

**To the Privacy-Conscious:** You shouldn't have to choose between insights and privacy. We've built Better Analytics to give you both.

**To Every Developer:** You deserve tools that understand how you work. Clean APIs, great documentation, TypeScript support, and integrations that just work. That's our promise.

## The Better Analytics Promise

- **Always Open Source:** Our code will always be available for you to inspect, modify, and learn from
- **Always Free to Self-Host:** The complete platform is free to deploy and run yourself, forever
- **Always Privacy-First:** Your users' privacy is not for sale
- **Always Developer-Focused:** Every decision is made with developer experience in mind

## Join Our Mission

Better Analytics isn't just a product - it's a movement. A movement towards better tools, better practices, and a better web. We're building something that puts developers first, respects privacy, and proves that great software can be both powerful and free.

Whether you're shipping your first app or your hundredth, whether you're a solo developer or part of a team, Better Analytics is here for you. Because at the end of the day, we're all just developers trying to build something amazing.
