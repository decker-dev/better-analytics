## Next.js Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with our Next.js integration:

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
import { Analytics } from 'better-analytics/next'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Analytics site="your-site-key" />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

<Callout title="Need a site key?">

</Callout>

## SaaS Platform Setup

### 1. Create Account

Visit [better-analytics.app](https://better-analytics.app) and sign up with:
- **Magic Link**: Passwordless authentication via email
- **GitHub**: OAuth integration
- **Google**: OAuth integration

### 2. Complete Onboarding

After signing up, you'll automatically get:
- A new organization created
- Your first site configured
- A unique site key generated

### 3. Get Your Site Key

During onboarding, you'll receive a site key like `BA_abc123`. Copy this for your integration.

### 4. Add to Your Website

Use the provided code examples for your framework:

```tsx tab="Next.js" title="app/layout.tsx"
import { Analytics } from 'better-analytics/next'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Analytics site="BA_your_site_key" />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```tsx tab="React" title="src/App.tsx"
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { init, trackPageview, track } from 'better-analytics'

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    init({ site: 'BA_your_site_key' })
    trackPageview()
  }, [])

  const handleClick = () => {
    track('button_click', { section: 'hero' })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```javascript tab="Vanilla JS" title="main.js"
import { init, trackPageview, track } from 'better-analytics'

// Initialize
init({ site: 'BA_your_site_key' })
trackPageview()

// Track custom events
document.getElementById('my-button')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
  track('button_click', { element: 'my-button' })
})
```

### 5. View Your Analytics

After implementing the code:
1. Visit your website to generate some events
2. Go to your [Better Analytics dashboard](https://better-analytics.app)
3. Navigate to your site's stats page
4. See real-time analytics data!

## Environment Variables

For production deployments, use environment variables:

```bash title=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BA_SITE=BA_your_site_key
# Optional: Custom endpoint for self-hosted instances
NEXT_PUBLIC_BA_URL=https://your-analytics-domain.com/api/collect
```

Then use without props:

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
import { Analytics } from 'better-analytics/next'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Analytics />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Custom Events

Track user interactions with custom events:

```tsx
import { track } from 'better-analytics'

// Track button clicks
track('button_click', { 
  button: 'hero-cta',
  page: 'homepage' 
})

// Track form submissions
track('form_submit', { 
  form: 'contact',
  success: true 
})

// Track feature usage
track('feature_used', { 
  feature: 'dark_mode',
  enabled: true 
})
```
